# Baltimore-NewportNews-Incarceration-Rates-Python

According this recently published [article](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2020/07/27/disparities/), recent protests and radical changes in the American policing system have brought national attention to the systematic racism within our criminal justice system. Although this is an issue rooted in many sectors beyond policing, the systematic racism in policing is evident ranging from sentencing and correctional discipline to pretrial processing and incarceration. Furthermore, the mass incarceration sweeping the nation is affecting many lives, particularly the lives of vulnerable communities such as people of color and other marginalized demographics in various socioeconomic classes. We will be specifically focusing on the relationship between incarceration rates and race (black and white) in Baltimore, Maryland vs. Newport News, VA. The main data source used to compare these cities was [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/), an open data source that uses anonymous data following 20 million Americans from childhood to their mid-30s.

Here we can see the outline of Newport News, Virginia where population data was taken from.  

### What is the incarceration rate among Black vs. White populations in Baltimorean neighborhoods?

bmore - black 
We can see that when Black and White popoulations are compared to All, the Black population remains at higher rates than both.

bmore - white 


### What is the incarceration rate among Black vs. White populations in Newport News neighborhoods?

Similarily, this microview of Newport News shows that the Black population is drastically above the average All and White population. 

## Summary 
Comparing the Black and White populations incarceration rates, black populations are average to be more than three times more likely to be incarcerated in Balitmore and in Newport News. When it comes to racial disparities in criminal justice reform and policy change, there needs to be reform efforts in identifying structural disadvantages and implicit biases.
